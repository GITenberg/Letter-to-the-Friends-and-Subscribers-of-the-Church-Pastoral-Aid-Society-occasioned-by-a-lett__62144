<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>SYNOPSIS
OF THE SOCIETY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Object</span>.&mdash;The salvation of
souls, with a single eye to the glory of God, and in humble
dependence on His blessing, by granting aid toward maintaining
faithful and devoted men to assist the Incumbents of Parishes in
their pastoral charge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Principles</span>.&mdash;That, in a
Christian land, a Church established should adequately provide
for the spiritual instruction of all the people; and that it is
part of the duty of a Christian Legislature to furnish the Church
with means to this end: but that, if the Legislature should fail
of this duty, then, rather than souls should perish, Christians
must join together, to supply the deficiency, and make the Church
as effective as it is in their power to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Plan</span>.&mdash;The Church Pastoral-Aid
Society strictly regards the wants of the Church on the one hand,
and the order of the Church on the other.&nbsp; It would make the
Church efficient; it would carry the Gospel, by means of the
Church, to every man&rsquo;s door, but it never intrudes its aid:
the Incumbent must apply for aid, or sanction the application;
and until this is done, the Society cannot move.&nbsp; When aid
is sought and granted, the Parochial Minister must say how it is
to be employed&mdash;he must nominate the persons to be
employed&mdash;he must engage them, as well as superintend and
entirely control them.&nbsp; All that the Society does, is to
provide for their remuneration; and, while so doing, to ask
satisfactory proof of their qualifications.</p>

<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>LETTER
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rev. Dr. Molesworth, a
Clergyman favourably known for some time past by the publication
of a periodical called the &ldquo;Penny Sunday
Reader,&rdquo;&mdash;who is likewise (as I perceive by the
Advertisement appended to his Pamphlet) Author of &ldquo;Family
Sermons for every Sunday in the Year,&rdquo; and whose promotion
from a small benefice in <i>Canterbury</i> to one of the largest
in the North of England was not long ago announced to the
public,&mdash;has lately signalized his zeal in another way, by
coming forward in the character of public prosecutor <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a> against the &ldquo;Church Pastoral-Aid
Society:&rdquo;&mdash;this he does in a printed Letter addressed
to his own Diocesan, and our respected Vice Patron, the Bishop of
Chester, containing serious charges affecting the whole character
and management of the Society.</p>
<p>The indictment sets forth, that the Society, in spite of
professed attachment to the Church, is in reality <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>doing it the
greatest injury, and chiefly by the exercise of a <i>veto</i>
upon the appointment of parties to be maintained upon its
grants.&nbsp; Dr. Molesworth therefore calls upon the Society to
put itself upon its defence,&mdash;to appear at his bar, and
answer to his indictment, upon pain of <i>sentence of
outlawry</i> to be pronounced against it by all the
orthodox.&nbsp; He further presses upon the subscribers and
friends of the Society, as yet more friends of the Church, the
necessity of transferring their subscriptions from the
&ldquo;Church Pastoral-Aid Society,&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Society
for promoting the employment of Additional Curates,
&amp;c.&rdquo;<a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p>This direct attempt to injure the Society, as well in its
funds as more vitally in its character, will make apology
needless on my part for following Dr. Molesworth in his appeal to
the Society at large; little as I may think his statements
calculated to effect their design of weakening your attachment to
<i>this tried instrument</i> (under God) of <i>so great an amount
of good</i>.&nbsp; And not suspecting that the Committee acting
for the whole Society&mdash;a Society comprising in its members
ten of the Episcopal order (including Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s own
Diocesan), many Church Dignitaries, the Regius Professor of
Divinity at Oxford, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;is likely so to forget
what is due to itself, as to descend into the arena of
controversy at the challenge of an individual; I thought it open
to any of the 1400 Clergy attached to the Society, against whom
<i>the sentence of outlawry</i> is <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>to be passed, to accept Dr.
Molesworth&rsquo;s challenge upon somewhat more equal terms.</p>
<p>The Society will naturally enough remark, upon a
<i>prim&acirc;-facie</i> view of Dr. M.&rsquo;s cry of
alarm,&mdash;&ldquo;We have all these learned and venerable
Bishops amongst us, these esteemed and valued Dignitaries; they
would have informed us, long ago, if we were justly chargeable
with the evil Dr. Molesworth has imputed to us:&rdquo;&mdash;but
either these learned and venerable men must be far less careful
for the interests of the Church than Dr. Molesworth, or else
(<i>not having sufficient discernment</i>?) failed to discover,
in the five years&rsquo; working of the Society, under all the
advantages of their connection with it, those evils which a
single observer at a distance, acting in the exercise of his
private judgment, has found so clear.&nbsp; Happy for the
Episcopal Bench, amidst all the mischief Dr. Molesworth has
<i>conjured up</i>, not only in the Society, but in the Church,
that there should be still left to them such a faithful adviser,
such a controller, such a corrector of their inadvertencies and
mistakes!&nbsp; We shall presently see what testimony is borne by
these learned and venerable men to the character and services of
the &ldquo;Church Pastoral-Aid Society;&rdquo; when it will be
for Dr. Molesworth to decide, how far his statement can be made
to tally with theirs; or otherwise, which of the two we shall
prefer.</p>
<p>Whether the Society is right or wrong in the exercise of its
<i>veto</i> upon the nomination of parties to occupy its grants,
is the main question at issue.&nbsp; A more satisfactory way of
dealing with it, than by following Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s
arrangement,&mdash;which (with the exception of what he has
culled from the Newspapers <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in his Preface and Appendix) is the
simple one, of first saying all that can be said in favour of the
Additional Curates&rsquo; Fund, and next, all that can be
<i>imagined</i> against the Church Pastoral Aid
Society,&mdash;will be, to place fully before you the simple and
intelligible principles upon which, in the question at issue, the
Church Pastoral-Aid Society acts.&nbsp; I speak as one well
acquainted with the Society&rsquo;s operations, but as having no
other authority for what I say.</p>
<p>Dr. Molesworth affirms (p. 13) that this rule of the Society
will not abide &ldquo;the sifting of <i>honesty</i> and common
sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us see.&nbsp; We contend,</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="GutSmall">I.</span>&nbsp; That
unworthy men do intrude themselves into the sacred ministry of
the Church.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="GutSmall">II.</span>&nbsp; That
it is a principle not unknown to the Church, that those who
provide the temporalities shall have a voice accorded to them in
the selection of parties to benefit by their appropriation.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="GutSmall">III.</span>&nbsp;
That to appoint such as unworthily intrude into the ministry of
the Church to cure of souls, is to be &ldquo;partaker of their
evil deeds.&rdquo;&nbsp; (2d Ep. John.)</p>
<p>In these particulars, it is presumed, will be comprehended a
full discussion of the question at issue.&nbsp; By the first
proposition, I intend to shew the expediency of the <i>veto</i>;
by the second, its lawfulness; and by the third, its bounden
obligation.</p>
<p>Previously, however, I would disclaim, for myself, and the
cause with which I would identify myself, all pleading at Dr.
Molesworth&rsquo;s tribunal;&mdash;a conclusion to which I am
forced by the perusal of his Letter.&mdash;<a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>I appeal not to
him;&mdash;and why?&nbsp; I discover him to be an
<i>incompetent</i>, because an <i>unfair</i> and
<i>presumptuous</i> judge.&nbsp; These are strong charges; and
only to be warranted if borne out by proofs derived from his own
Letter.</p>
<p>To his revered Diocesan appeal would have been superfluous,
who well knows how to appreciate the becoming sneer at
&ldquo;<i>spiritually-minded</i>,&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>evangelical</i>,&rdquo; and every thing of that
sort.&nbsp; Indeed, a less-disguised antipathy to real Religion,
in my judgment, <i>these later days</i> have seldom
witnessed,&mdash;at least in print, and from one of the
Clergy.&nbsp; My appeal is to those whom Dr. Molesworth would
seek to pervert (vide App. p. 39), the friends and supporters of
the Society: and I ask them, whether Dr. Molesworth has not
prejudged already, from the temper and style of his pamphlet, the
cause which he affects to put on trial?&nbsp; A few extracts will
shew.&nbsp; He commences temperately enough; calling for, in page
7,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An abandonment of the objectionable test,
or at least a clear and explicit understanding upon the character
and designs of the Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; And adding, &ldquo;The
Society owes to itself as well as to the Church, an official
vindication from the questionable (to say the least)
<i>appearances</i> against it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such likewise was the tenor of his original Letter to the
Manchester Courier (p. 4).&nbsp; But, as he warms upon his theme,
he forgets this prudent part of his plan.&nbsp; Page 15, we find
the <i>veto</i> thus described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is an <i>insidious</i> plan;&mdash;it is
a plan <i>fit for a society</i> with <i>shabby</i>, <i>party</i>,
<i>and sectarian</i> designs, but not for a society <i>with
simply and singly Church views</i>.&nbsp; It places the Society
above the Bishops and Archbishops,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 14, he had remarked&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will not affirm that the rule was
designed to be the <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>instrument of a <i>shabby and crooked</i> policy; but I
will affirm, that if it <i>had</i> been so designed, it could not
have been better <i>contrived</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The insinuation here conveyed is that amplified, as we have
seen, in the very next page, by which we may judge at what rate
Dr. Molesworth travels.&mdash;Page 20, he feels shy of saying
that this rule <i>is</i> the instrument of &ldquo;a
<i>dangerous</i> and <i>double-faced</i> policy;&rdquo; whilst he
does not hesitate to style (p. 23) those who have the working of
the rule, &ldquo;<i>despotic</i>, and <i>irresponsible</i>&rdquo;
(!) managers.&mdash;The Secretary of our Society (the Rev. E. B.
Were) had wound up an unpleasant correspondence (for it is always
unpleasant to tell a man he will not do) with a layman (Mr.
Briarly Browne), whose friend, the Rev. Mr. Clark, had sought for
him a grant from the Society, upon which Mr. Briarly Browne was
to be ordained; brooding all the while, and hardly suppressing,
considerable ill-will to the Society in their hearts.&nbsp; The
endeavour on the part of our Secretary to expose this unhandsome
proceeding is stigmatized as &ldquo;a poor shuffling
attempt&rdquo; (p. 24).&nbsp; <i>Previously</i>, Dr. Molesworth
had <i>admitted</i> (p. 18) that this was done &ldquo;<i>with
some</i>, <i>but rather severe</i>, <i>justice</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I pass by another charge, in the same page, of more serious and
offensive character, which Dr. Molesworth greedily catches up
from a Letter of Mr. Clark; intending to return to it by and
by.&nbsp; But after all, nothing of this kind comes up to the
appendix:&mdash;he has bade adieu to the Bishop, and has got a
little out of sight;&mdash;and now hear him:&mdash;what was but
<i>the lion passant guardant</i> before, is become truly the lion
<i>rampant</i> now.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Society&rdquo; (he says, p.
36), &ldquo;<i>in the plenitude of their super-papal
authority</i>, <i>have </i><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span><i>thought fit to
declare</i>!!!&rdquo;&mdash;and at the end of the next
extract&mdash;&ldquo;Is not this <i>monstrous</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are these Church principles?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is such a
tribunal of <i>intolerance</i> and <i>sectarianism</i>!! to stand
forth and collect money, and to be advocated in our pulpits as a
Church Society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, friends and supporters of the Church Pastoral-Aid
Society, are you willing to be tried by Dr. Molesworth, or are
you convinced that he has made up his mind before you come into
Court?&nbsp; If the Society, or the Committee it appoints as
among its most responsible members, be deserving of such <i>rank
abuse</i> as this, where is the need of inquiry?&nbsp; Bad indeed
must the Society be decided to be;&mdash;bad in its principles,
bad in its management, bad in its officers; in short, all bad
together.&nbsp; Why, then, does Dr. Molesworth dwell so tamely,
at the outset, upon &ldquo;<i>questionable appearances which
require vindication</i>&rdquo;?&nbsp; Wherefore does he affect to
call for &ldquo;<i>a clear and explicit understanding upon the
character and designs of the Society</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (P. 7, and
Letter to the Manchester Courier.)</p>
<p>If the matter needs no inquiry, why does Dr. Molesworth make a
show of demanding it?&nbsp; And if it does, why does he approach
the question in such a predetermined spirit of hostility as to
make <i>the proposal</i>, in his case, <i>a deception</i>;
shewing that he at least has settled the question <i>before</i>
(as he admits) he has heard it.</p>
<p>There is no disguising it&mdash;Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s
objection lies far deeper: this will be seen, as we enter further
into the consideration of his attack.&nbsp; <i>The ostensible
grounds</i> of objection shift about.&nbsp; The employment of Lay
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>agents is
now <i>the minor matter</i> (pp. 18 and 19).&nbsp; It was the
major, onewhile; but the Society having suffered as much loss as
the urging and mis-stating of that objection could inflict, and
having happily survived the injuries, <i>the major point
sinks</i>, <i>and becomes the minor</i> (as you perceive), and
<i>the minor is now the major</i>, and so on; for reproach will
never be wanting against a Society founded, supported, and (under
God) successfully worked by those whose religious sentiments Dr.
Molesworth treats with undisguised aversion.&nbsp; Else why that
strange loathing of the very word
&ldquo;<i>spiritually-minded</i>&rdquo;; so that he has actually
clipped it of a full syllable?&nbsp; It is a curious fact, that
the Rev. Doctor has quoted this word (in allusion to the Letter
of the Rev. Mr. Were, Secretary to the Society), but always
writing it thus, &ldquo;<i>spiritual-minded</i>,&rdquo; no less
than <i>eleven times in twenty pages</i>, and evidently in a tone
of derision.&nbsp; Now, when a Doctor of Divinity takes up a
Scriptural term only <i>to disparage it</i>, and others by it;
and actually mistakes the orthography of the word, as though it
were quite new to him, and foreign to his taste; it is high time
we should quote him the passage at length wherein it occurs, and
then leave it with him:&mdash;Rom. viii. 6: &ldquo;To be
carnally-minded is death, but to be spiritually-minded is life
and peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Molesworth can do justice to the Society in nothing; he
cannot even allow it its real title: yet one would think, that
the good he is forced to admit, to a certain extent, that the
Society has done <i>in</i> the Church, and <i>not out of</i> the
Church, might, in a lesser sense at least, and putting aside all
courtesy to his clerical brethren in the Society, entitle it to
be called <i>a</i> &ldquo;Church Pastoral-Aid
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not so, for (p. 25) <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the Society
is a &ldquo;<i>Lay Society</i>&rdquo;!&nbsp; What Dr. Molesworth
does with the <i>ten Bishops</i>, so high a Churchman as he would
be thought, I marvel: when <i>they</i> are treated thus, his 1400
brethren of the Clergy will, of course, go for nothing!&nbsp; The
title given us of &ldquo;<i>Lay Society</i>,&rdquo; however, is
adopted from the Letter of Mr. Briarly Browne; a layman himself,
be it observed, but who (<i>proh pudor</i>!) will not bestow the
name of Churchman upon Bishop or Archbishop, Dignitary or Parish
Priest, so long as they remain connected with this Society!&nbsp;
Might it not have served his turn to have denounced the Society
as a mixed Society of Lay and Clergy, an unauthorised Society, or
any thing more offensive that he pleased, which would at least
have spared the Church Dignitaries attached to the Society <i>the
insult</i> of being reckoned as <i>laymen</i>, <i>or nothing</i>;
and by which this layman would not have set his clerical champion
the bad example he was not slow to follow, of <i>casting
contempt</i> (as I cannot but consider it) upon the highest
authorities of the Church.</p>
<p>Another, and the most unmeasured of all their charges against
the Society, is likewise adopted by the Doctor from the Letter of
Mr. Clark, that of &ldquo;<i>raising money upon false
pretences</i>!!!&rdquo;&nbsp; This, in other terms, accuses the
Society of <i>swindling</i>; and to this no defence will be
conceded on my part.&nbsp; If the authors of the charge can
believe it, I pity them: in my judgment, it refutes itself.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, as an offence cognisable by our laws,&mdash;they
will pardon me the suggestion,&mdash;it will afford them the very
opportunity they appear to seek, of exposing, as well as
annoying, the Committee of the Society in open court; <i>provided
only the proofs are at hand</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Little
as I am disposed to bandy words, I might ask, if a Society,
having fully, fairly, and publicly declared its principles, (and
I believe there never was a Society which carried the practice to
a greater extent,) and had thereby published upon what terms its
money was subscribed and its grants made, so that there could be
no mistake; and if others, knowing and hating its principles
equally, had, notwithstanding, proposed themselves as parties to
benefit by its funds whilst they eluded its principles; who would
be raising money upon false pretences, in that case?</p>
<p>Here I cannot refrain from reporting an earlier specimen of
the bad faith the Society has experienced at the hands of those
whose dislike it may have merited by diligence in the Church
Pastoral-Aid.&nbsp; The facts are known to the subscribers
generally; but are again introduced here, to shew, that when the
&ldquo;<i>minor matter</i>,&rdquo; as Lay-agency is <i>now</i>
called, was urged as the <i>major</i>, (before it had fallen so
many degrees by Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s <i>disciplinometer</i>,)
the Society was not a jot the less liable to misrepresentation
and unkindness than now.</p>
<p>The following statement appeared in a work of a popular
character, published in 1838 anonymously, and called &ldquo;<i>A
Voice from the Font</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An Incumbent of a populous town in the West
of England applied for two Lay-teachers, who were granted; but
who, after establishing an acquaintance and intimacy with the
parishioners, became Dissenting Ministers of the town, drawing to
them those whom they had visited as the delegates of the
Incumbent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This stood in the relation of a note, containing the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>proof, or
substantial part of an excellent argument against Lay-assistance
and the Church Pastoral-Aid Society.&nbsp; Alas! the whole was
pure invention.&nbsp; But all men are liable to err, and to
derive information from incorrect sources.&nbsp; The publisher
was therefore apprised, and the Editor of the Church-of-England
Quarterly Review, <i>which had copied the objectionable
passage</i>, written to.&nbsp; The Author of the book, understood
to be a Clergyman, was appealed to: there could be no doubt of
the mistake (to call it by the mildest name); and the publishers,
Messrs. Longman &amp; Co., consequently received authority to
paste over the note in all future and unsold copies.</p>
<p>Now the Society thought that more was due to it: the libel had
gone through the length and breadth of the land.&nbsp; So void of
truth was the statement, that, in point of fact, no Incumbent in
the West of England ever had two Lay-assistants <i>paid</i> by
the Society:&mdash;(to nominate them, I beg to acquaint the
&ldquo;<i>Poor Parson</i>&rdquo; p. 5, is always left to the
Incumbent himself); and <i>not a single instance</i> has
occurred, since the formation of the Society, of any Lay-agent,
supported by its means, becoming a Dissenting Teacher.&nbsp; Yet
all attempt to obtain further redress was hopeless: no sorrow was
expressed by the party who had circulated <i>the false
report</i>; no proper feeling shewn for having wounded a
much-called-for Christian Charity;&mdash;no apology,&mdash;no
reparation,&mdash;<i>no answer</i>, in short, was given to the
Society&rsquo;s appeal!&nbsp; I know not what effect the relation
of such injustice may have on other minds: it made me the zealous
friend of the &ldquo;Church Pastoral-Aid Society:&rdquo;
previously content with being its well-wisher, I had taken no
part in its proceedings: since then, I am thankful to say, I
have.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Hitherto, my object has been, to expose the
<i>animus</i> of these attacks: though painful, it was necessary
to do so, lest any one should conceive that Dr. Molesworth, and
those who think with him, are men who may be easily satisfied; or
that by giving up one point, however vital, we should silence
opposition.&nbsp; Does <i>the spirit</i> displayed in their
attacks afford us any fair grounds for hoping this?&nbsp; Was not
Lay-agency first attacked, as <i>the veto</i> is now?&nbsp; Does
not the reproach of &ldquo;<i>Lay Society</i>&rdquo; announce
that the whole Society must be re-constituted, from the top-stone
to the bottom?&nbsp; In short, these gentlemen <i>will be
satisfied</i> when we have given up every thing, and have nothing
more left to give up.&nbsp; Bear in mind, that they have already
established a Society (a Church Society they call theirs), for
the same objects, upon their own model;&mdash;I do not say, in
opposition to, but a year or more after the Pastoral-Aid
Society.&nbsp; One would think, if Dr. Molesworth could do
justice to the Society in any thing, it would be <i>as parent</i>
of <i>a child</i> so hopeful, so highly-prized, and so
justly-commended by himself, as the Society for the employment of
Additional Curates &amp;c.&nbsp; Standing in this relation to
each other, it is painful to learn from Dr. Molesworth the
probability of their becoming &ldquo;<i>bitter rivals</i>&rdquo;
(p. 27).&nbsp; On the part of <i>the parent</i>, I am sure, no
such <i>unnatural</i> sentiment prevails; and I trust it would
continue to be so, were the respective positions changed, and the
daughter <i>flourished</i> as much, or more, than the mother.</p>
<p>Far more congenial to my feelings than the topics which have
engaged us hitherto, will be the discussion upon certain definite
principles, as was proposed, of the use of the <i>veto</i>.&nbsp;
My first proposition was a question <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>of fact scarcely requiring proof; yet
indeed the whole argument depends upon it: for could it be proved
that no evil men exist in the Church as ministers, then the
Society&rsquo;s rule would doubtless be unnecessary, offensive,
and chargeable with party motives.&nbsp; But I assert,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That unworthy men do intrude themselves into the
sacred ministry of the Church.</p>
<p>A proposition so plain amounts, in fact, to a truism; yet it
affords in itself, to my mind, and upon Christian principles, a
sufficient vindication of the Society&rsquo;s rule.&nbsp; Some
escape the vigilance of the Bishop at ordination; and some fall
away, like the unhappy Dr. Dodd, and others, from a state of
considerable usefulness and credit.&nbsp; Thus it was in the
earliest ages of the Church, and in the presence of extraordinary
inspiration.&nbsp; A &ldquo;<i>Demas</i>, <i>having loved this
present world</i>,&rdquo; forsook his master: and Paul
prophesied, that, after his departure from Ephesus,
&ldquo;<i>grievous wolves</i> should <i>enter in</i>, not sparing
the flock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Also, <i>of your
ownselves</i>,&rdquo; adds he, &ldquo;<i>shall men arise</i>,
<i>speaking perverse things</i>, to draw away disciples after
them:&rdquo; Acts xx. 29, 30.&nbsp; Or, without speaking of our
own times, to come to times bordering upon our own; who has not
heard of an assembly of Divines of the Church of England meeting
for the purpose of obtaining relief to their consciences from
subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles, which they had already
subscribed?&nbsp; These were men whom the Church Pastoral-Aid
Society, Low-Church, or No-Church as it may be called, would
never have supported from its funds, nor put itself in the way of
doing so.&nbsp; Leave it in the hands of the Bishops to refuse
their licence, is Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s <i>panacea</i>.&nbsp;
Dr. Molesworth <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>would throw all upon the Bishops.&mdash;And was it, Dr.
Molesworth, not left in the hands of the Bishops at that very
time, long before any Church Pastoral-Aid Society was heard
of?</p>
<p>I know it will be thought invidious, in more ways than one, to
take the course I do, upon this proposition.&nbsp; I may content
myself with Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s Apology to his Diocesan (p.
26), by affirming only with more reason, that &ldquo;the
importance of the subject requires that no courtesies should
suppress <i>plain speaking</i> upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towards the
Episcopal body I would conduct myself with the utmost deference
and respect.&nbsp; In what I shall say, I would refer but to the
past.&nbsp; Are not Bishops elected at that time of life, in a
majority of cases, which would preclude them from acting very
long with the promptitude and vigour which Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s
system would require?&nbsp; A remark to that effect fell from the
lips of good Bishop Horne, as he ascended the steps to his
episcopal palace at Norwich for the first time.</p>
<p>It is blindness to expect in Bishops more than can be found in
man&mdash;more than was found in Apostles.&nbsp; It is ill
service to their cause and ours, to load them with
responsibility, to expect more of them than they can give,
teaching others the same lesson, and making (to use an obvious
figure) <i>the head</i> the most active of all the members.&nbsp;
If the Bishops are to depend upon the information of others, I
may ask, Are ordinary testimonials never unsound?&nbsp; Does
personal character always come out, in divinity examinations
before their chaplains?&nbsp; Again, when corrupt men are in the
Church, who does not know the difficulty (perhaps in some degree
necessary, upon a balance of <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>evils, and all things considered) in
removing them?&nbsp; One case of that kind, in a diocese not far
from the metropolis, cost more anxiety, pains, and expenditure in
the Ecclesiastical Court to Bishop after Bishop (though the
circumstances were flagrant) than it would be possible for them
often to repeat.&nbsp; Here we have a vindication of the Bishops
upon the point of allowing corrupt men to remain in the Church;
and here we have the propriety of the Society&rsquo;s <i>veto</i>
confirmed, and the inexpediency of Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s
suggestion of laying all the <i>onus</i> upon Bishops.</p>
<p>While men in holy orders are to be found devotees of the
ball-room, the card-table, and the race-course, in spite of the
remonstrances of the refined Bishop Jebb,&mdash;whilst men are to
be found as ministers of Christ, throwing the peculiar doctrines
of the Gospel into the shade, in spite of the indignation of
Bishop Horsley against &ldquo;the apes of
Epictetus,&rdquo;&mdash;it is no time for those who are attached
to the Church to lay aside precaution against the
mal-appropriation of consecrated funds.&nbsp; At the (last?)
Races in <i>Canterbury</i>, which the magistrates tried to put
down, on account of the immorality and disorder attending them, a
distinguished list of Clergy was announced as having been present
on the &ldquo;grand stand;&rdquo;&mdash;a <i>grand stand</i>,
indeed, for the Clergy!&mdash;I wish the statement were too
improbable to need contradiction.&nbsp; It is found in a work
written by a Clergyman of the Church of England, reviewed in a
daily print of considerable circulation.&nbsp; Provided it be
true, are these men whom Dr. Molesworth would have us receive
&ldquo;as faithful and devoted&rdquo; without question, of whose
habits this appearance on &ldquo;the grand stand&rdquo; at
<i>Canterbury</i> is a specimen?&nbsp; The Committee of the
Church Pastoral-Aid Society consider, with Bishop <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Jebb, that
they are <i>so far</i> the reverse.&nbsp; Our idea of
<i>faithfulness</i> would comprise the not being present, as
pleased spectators, in the resorts of immorality; and of
<i>devotedness</i>, the being far better employed.</p>
<p>Dr. Molesworth inquires (p. 24) what <span
class="GutSmall">TESTS</span> of character and qualifications the
Society uses.&nbsp; Is the doctrine and discipline of the Church
of England none?&nbsp; The question is raised, I suppose, because
Dr. Molesworth cannot disabuse his mind of the petty suspicion,
that High and Low Church (p. 28) are the points upon which the
examination turns.&nbsp; Does Dr. Molesworth really suspect
this?&nbsp; If so, let me undeceive him at once: the Clerical
Committee of that Society are, I trust, as distinguished for
conformity and attachment to the Church as himself; and in this
sense no one could be nominated who was <i>too High-Church</i>
for them.&nbsp; When, however, we do all that is required of us,
and give our <span class="GutSmall">TESTS</span> more <i>in
detail</i>, what do we gain by it?&nbsp; Dr. Molesworth finds
nothing but <i>vagueness</i> in our
requirements&mdash;<i>vagueness</i> in what we find most
explicit.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Faithful</i>, <i>devoted</i>,&rdquo;
&amp;c. (p. 15), &ldquo;<i>is vague</i>;&rdquo;
&ldquo;<i>spiritual-mindedness</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>is
vague</i>&rdquo; (p. 16), which is repeated (p. 22); and an
<i>admirable</i> note in the next page (23), explaining the
rejection of a candidate, is spoken of as written in
&ldquo;<i>hide-and-seek phraseology</i>;&rdquo; where, as Dr.
Molesworth formerly <i>clipped</i>, so now he <i>coins</i> a word
to shew his little respect for the Society.&nbsp; I do beg the
attention of the friends and subscribers of the Church
Pastoral-Aid Society to the Letter referred to <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>, not as an illustration of the
Doctor&rsquo;s <i>discovery</i> of what he is pleased to name
&ldquo;<i>hide and-seek phraseology</i>,&rdquo; but as <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>a very
luminous and compendious refutation of the Doctor&rsquo;s <i>hard
words</i>, and aspersion of the <i>veto</i>.&nbsp; The Poet
speaks of things</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Dark with excess
of light:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>upon some such phenomenon, methinks, Dr. Molesworth must have
stumbled, as respects the Letter in question.&nbsp; He professes
to be quite in the dark likewise&mdash;to which Mr. B. Browne led
the way&mdash;as to the possibility of discerning, <i>without
looking into the heart</i>, <i>who are spiritually-minded</i> (p.
17).&nbsp; Scripture holds out to him a candle: &ldquo;By their
fruits ye shall know them!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The fruits of the
flesh are <i>manifest</i>:&rdquo; Gal. v. 19.&nbsp; The fruits of
the Spirit, or spiritual-mindedness, which are the reverse of the
former, are likewise enumerated in the same portion of
Scripture.&nbsp; But where individuals are not known to us, how
shall we judge? (for this I suspect is their last shift.)&nbsp;
Simply by taking the judgment of those <i>who are
spiritually-minded</i>, <i>devoted</i>, <i>faithful</i>, and the
like, and know the candidate;&mdash;in short, the best testimony
that can be obtained: there is no mystery in the matter, the
course taken in every inquiry as to character is the course taken
by the Clerical Committee and Secretaries, and one by which the
truth can seldom fail to come to light.&nbsp; That I may not be
said to shrink from any part of this discussion, I come to the
case of Mr. Briarly Browne himself.&mdash;First of all, as to his
testimonials.&nbsp; Any one knowing how unreflectingly
testimonials of every kind are given, will see the necessity of
looking narrowly into them, when so great a matter is at stake,
as appointments, or the approval of them, in the Church.&nbsp; It
cannot but be perceived by our friends and supporters, as well as
by the public <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>at large, that the gist of the accusations against the
Committee is the care and strictness with which they discharge
their trust.&nbsp; In the next place, the Bishop of
Chester&rsquo;s countersign to the testimonials of the three
beneficed Clergymen presented by Mr. Browne amounted to this,
that <i>they were Clergymen</i> officiating in his diocese, and
&ldquo;<i>worthy of credit</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly, the
testimonials themselves are, <i>to my mind</i>, both guarded and
limited in their expression, and not of a decided
character.&nbsp; The two first set forth briefly what <i>they
believe</i> Mr. Browne to be, &amp;c.: the third, more strongly I
allow, states, that the writer has <i>every reason to
believe</i>, but (what?) the matter deposed to would appear both
meagre and insufficient to me, if it was all I had as
recommendation for a Curate or substitute for my own duties.</p>
<p>It can answer no good purpose to quote at length a
correspondence which the parties who think themselves aggrieved
lost no time in sending to the Newspapers.&nbsp; I can only
express my coincidence with the Secretary of the Society, in
thinking that the testimonials, (if) good as far as they went,
yet fell short of giving <i>full satisfaction</i> as to
&ldquo;Christian character and qualifications:&rdquo; and since I
would not flinch from the most open discussion of the subject at
issue, I will tell my Reverend Brethren, Dr. Molesworth and Mr.
Clark, the sort of testimonial which I think called for by the
occasion: for instance,&mdash;not only that I
&ldquo;believed,&rdquo; but that I was fully convinced, upon
sufficient evidence, or knowledge of the party, that he was both
a sincere Churchman, and still more a sincere Christian;
preaching, or desiring to preach, the doctrines contained in the
Articles, and those in their proper order: first, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>&ldquo;the
Name which is above every name,&rdquo; (&ldquo;for there is none
other whereby we must be saved,&rdquo;) and afterwards every
thing else in due subordination, with no mixing up essentials and
non-essentials as of equal worth: and further, that his life
exhibited tokens of his having been &ldquo;born of the
Spirit,&rdquo; by humility, meekness, temperance, devotedness,
holiness, &amp;c., as the case might be.&nbsp; Such a testimonial
surely could not be chargeable with the spirit of party; nor is
there any thing overstrained, I conceive, in its language or
requirements: and yet three such testimonials, I feel certain,
from persons of credit, would never be rejected by the
Committee.</p>
<p>I would fain be spared the entering upon any of the doctrinal
peculiarities of the day; but am bound, in conscience, to add,
that if I knew of any one holding the doctrine, condemned by the
Bishop of Exeter in his last Charge, of <i>reserve in
communicating the doctrine of the Atonement</i>, nothing more
would be required, in my judgment, to call for the exercise of
the <i>veto</i>.&mdash;We can but do as we would be done
by.&nbsp; Let Dr. Molesworth put himself in the position of the
Clerical Committee: would he recommend to others a Curate that he
could not conscientiously appoint himself? or would he <i>assent
to</i> the appointment of a Curate (for that is more correctly
our case), if he were trustee for another, provided his own mind
were not satisfied as to the fitness of the individual
proposed?&nbsp; Is any one so simple as to believe that Dr.
Molesworth would take <i>the first person that offered</i>, or
choose <i>blindfold</i> as it were, for his own Curate.&nbsp;
Many of our brethren, I believe, delegate the choice of their
Curates to friends in the ministry, upon whose judgment they have
more reliance than on their own.&nbsp; <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>What does the Church Pastoral-Aid
Society more than these (it does not half so much)? except, that
where its judgment is asked, it bountifully pays the Curate that
is appointed.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But it might be argued, that allowing unworthy men
did so intrude, and establish themselves in the Church,&mdash;for
the fact is indisputable, making the necessity for vigilance
manifest,&mdash;we could not meddle as a Society, or Committee of
Laymen, or Clergymen, either or both with a view of repairing the
evil, by rejecting nominations to our grants on account of the
character of Clergymen nominated to us, without violating the
plain order of the Church.&nbsp; Is it so?&mdash;then where is it
laid down? for we should like to have the <i>very words of
authority produced</i>; being most unwilling to forfeit our
protection of the <i>veto</i>, so strong a necessity for which is
shewn, unless the Church has spoken very plainly and
authoritatively against it.&nbsp; All I can gather upon this
subject from Dr. Molesworth, is in the way of assertion, rather
than of authority and proof.&nbsp; There is plenty of
<i>surmise</i> of evil to the Church, and everywhere an
<i>assumed</i> departure from order on our part; but what proof
is given?&nbsp; I am sure I cannot see it in the prayer for the
Clergy and people which Dr. Molesworth has alleged for that
purpose.&nbsp; What decree, canon, or judgment of the Church, has
he quoted?&nbsp; As most decisive in the controversy, I would by
no means pass over that Scriptural argument from Acts vi. 2, 3;
where the whole &ldquo;multitude of the disciples&rdquo; were
solicited by the Apostles to select &ldquo;men of honest report,
full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,&rdquo; to be afterwards
ordained by themselves.&nbsp; To judge who were fit for the <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>office of
Deacon is here manifestly delegated to the body of believers; and
those we call Laity were constituted judges as to who were
&ldquo;of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and
wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; The multitude made choice because they had
raised the common fund which the Deacons were to distribute.</p>
<p>Let us come to the actual law and system of the Church.&nbsp;
Laymen, consistently with the order of the Church, purchase or
inherit, and appoint to benefices; and afterwards the Bishop
inducts.&nbsp; This is in no small degree analogous to granting
the means for, and consenting to, the nomination of Curates to
the Bishops for licence.&nbsp; Corporate bodies, as the
Haberdashers&rsquo; or Goldsmiths&rsquo; Company, without a
Clergyman among them, exercise the right of patronage over
livings in their gift.&nbsp; The Trustees of new Churches or
Chapels, commonly laymen, upon providing a certain endowment,
obtain Episcopal consecration for their edifices, and exercise
the whole right of selecting and appointing Ministers, to be
afterwards licensed by the Bishop; the consecration of their
wealth to the Church entitling them, I suppose, in the
Church&rsquo;s view, to this privilege of nomination in
return.&nbsp; The parties I have specified make election
according to their views of Clergymen or applicants, their
doctrine and manner of life.&nbsp; Nobody has ever objected to
it, as far as I know at least, as inconsistent with the present
order of our Church.&nbsp; Late Acts of Parliament are enlarging
the facilities by which the Laity erect and endow Churches upon
consideration of the selection and nomination of Ministers being
in their own hands.</p>
<p>If it were possible that the Church Pastoral-Aid <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Society, by
the exercise of a simple <i>veto</i> upon the nomination of
Curates to fill its grants, should endanger the
Church,&mdash;what if its object were changed, its funds invested
in Church property, and it had in its hands <i>the whole
appointment</i> to as many livings as could be purchased with its
annual income; that is, of Incumbents, and Curates too,
virtually;&mdash;a proceeding against which no one would have a
right to complain, or power to act, as contrary to the principles
of the Church?&mdash;If a Society may consistently with the laws
of the Church appoint to livings, why may it not exercise a
negative voice in Curacies?&nbsp; If it may do the greater, why
may it not do the less?&mdash;The Church Pastoral-Aid Society
asks for no right to nominate or appoint, but only, that, in any
appointment made by others to the benefit of its grants, the
Society should be satisfied that what it gives is not, as we have
seen it might be, unworthily bestowed.&nbsp; Is this more than
the Church is in the habit of allowing, in return for the
consecration of wealth to God; or is it less?&nbsp; Dr.
Molesworth is very sore on the subject of the <i>veto</i>.&nbsp;
P. 15, he asserts that the retention of it makes the nomination,
engagement, &amp;c., promised to the Incumbent, &ldquo;a <i>mere
bubble</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suppose, then, that the <i>veto</i> has
been exercised as one in ten, or one in twenty, (I speak in
entire ignorance of the real proportion,) would Dr. Molesworth
affirm, that in the cases where the Incumbent&rsquo;s domination
has been accepted at once, the <i>veto</i> nevertheless proves
those nominations to be a bubble?&nbsp; The nature of a
<i>veto</i> is well known: at the most, it is but half, and the
worst half, of an appointment; for vigilance may be lulled, and
resolution wearied out.&nbsp; <i>Let not the Society</i>, <i>for
the Church&rsquo;s sake</i>, <i>be provoked to justify itself in
</i><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>detail for the use of it</i>.&nbsp; In the blindness
of his anger against the <i>veto</i>, the Rev. Doctor declares
that it makes the promised appointment by the Incumbent &ldquo;a
<i>mere bubble</i>;&rdquo; entirely overlooking, that in the
great majority of cases where the Incumbent&rsquo;s nomination is
accepted, <i>the Curate is left thenceforward entirely under his
controul</i>; the Society losing sight of the individual
altogether&mdash;for years it may be&mdash;unless the Incumbent
himself bring the appointment once more under its review.&nbsp; I
thought it not beside my purpose to follow Dr. Molesworth at this
point upon the <i>effect</i> of the <i>veto</i>; but my
proposition is the <i>lawfulness of the use of it</i>, which I
have endeavoured to shew by the analogy of appointments to
spiritual offices, such as the Church allows to the Laity, either
individuals or Societies, in return for the endowments they
furnish.</p>
<p>Precedents are besides afforded us in the existence of other
Societies of much earlier date, exercising similar or greater
powers, and recognised by the Church.&nbsp; The Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge, and (by <i>special licence of
certain gentlemen who have invented a standard for the purpose of
determining the fact</i>) <i>a</i> <span
class="GutSmall">CHURCH</span> Society, patronized by the whole
Episcopal Bench, is likewise a Society very liberally
constituted; all members, Lay or Clerical, having a vote in the
proceedings.&nbsp; Members are Clergymen or Laymen being Annual
Subscribers of a Guinea.&nbsp; Now this Society, besides its
dissemination of the Scriptures, &amp;c., has the credit of
having instituted the first Missions in our colonies
abroad.&nbsp; The great, the benign, the venerable
Swartz&mdash;or, <i>may</i> I say, &ldquo;the faithful and
devoted&rdquo; Swartz&mdash;was one of those employed in
them.&nbsp; Till <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>of late, the Charges of the Society to its Missionaries
appeared, as a Tract for sale, on its Catalogue.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a Society of the most liberal character,
acting with the <i>full</i> concurrence of the Episcopal Bench,
<i>selecting</i>, and <i>appointing</i>, as well as paying
Missionaries.&nbsp; It is true, as the Christian-Knowledge
Society enlarged its operations, it transferred this part of its
business to a separate Society, the Society for Propagating the
Gospel in Foreign Parts, but the precedent still remains.&nbsp;
Before that time, any member of that Society might have sat in
judgment upon, and a majority of Lay-members might have put the
<i>veto</i> practically upon Missionaries nominated by the
Clergy; or, <i>vice-vers&acirc;</i>, nominated the Missionaries
disapproved by the Clergy.&nbsp; So I read the constitution of
this Church Society:&mdash;if I am wrong, there are many who will
be glad to set me right.&nbsp; Members had, and must have had,
the same power over Missionaries that they originally had over
Tracts; the same power that they had over the appointment of all
their officers.&nbsp; Such, I say, was the constitution, whatever
may have been the practice of the Society: any Member might have
<i>stood upon his right</i> to exercise a vote in the appointment
of Missionaries; and, furthermore, if the practice of the Society
in this respect had been to delegate its right to the clerical
members of its body, as best qualified to judge of the fitness of
persons for spiritual offices, this would only make the case more
analogous to that of the Church Pastoral-Aid Society, which
confides the trust of examining into the character of candidates
for its grants solely to the clerical members of its
Subcommittee.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Follow
the case to the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign
Parts, which is likewise, according to the <i>exact
discrimination</i> of some gentlemen, a Church Society.&nbsp;
Whatever difference may exist between it and the Society for
Promoting Christian Knowledge, their constitutions in one respect
are similar; viz. that the governing body are a mixed Committee
of Laymen and Clergy, in whom must necessarily vest all
appointments and distribution of funds: if they should delegate
the nomination of Missionaries to their clerical members, they do
exactly what the Church Pastoral-Aid Society is doing; only with
this difference, that the Church Pastoral-Aid Society exercises a
<i>negative</i> and <i>partial</i>, the others a <i>positive</i>
and <i>absolute</i> voice in their appointments.&nbsp; It is time
I should quote the actual Rules of one of these two Church
Societies, with whom the whole business of the Missions is now
lodged.&nbsp; Rule <span class="GutSmall">XVII</span>. of the
Society for Propagating the Gospel is,</p>
<blockquote><p>17.&nbsp; <i>That no Missionary be employed until
the fullest inquiry has been made into his fitness and
sufficiency</i>; <i>and that all persons applying for Missions
shall produce testimonials</i>, <i>signed by three beneficed
Clergymen</i>, <i>and countersigned by the Bishop of the Diocese
in which those Clergymen are beneficed</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, Dr. Molesworth! a Society, a mixed Society,
<i>examine</i> and <span class="GutSmall">APPOINT</span> to
sacred <i>offices</i>, <i>judging</i> of <i>fitness</i> and
<i>sufficiency</i>: and not only so, but <span
class="GutSmall">AFTER</span> testimonials by three Clergymen,
countersigned by the Bishop of the Diocese, &amp;c.&nbsp; Even
so! and this is a Church Society!!&nbsp; I will not inquire, with
the Rev. Dr. Molesworth (p. 16), &ldquo;Upon what Church
principle are the testimonials of these men to be set aside, for
the vague affirmation that the candidate is&rdquo; <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>&ldquo;not
fit nor sufficient;&rdquo;&mdash;but I might do so with as much
justice as Dr. Molesworth has shewn to the Church Pastoral-Aid
Society.</p>
<p>To guard against the intrusion of unfit persons to the sacred
office, every precaution is desirable: and I am by no means a
less well-affected member of the Society for Propagating the
Gospel on account of this rule.&nbsp; Dr. Molesworth may be
affected in a directly opposite manner, and not allow their
practice to be any vindication of ours.&nbsp; At all events, I
have made good my position: here are <i>Church Societies</i>
acting upon a principle of appointment to sacred offices by
Laymen and Clergy in union; only carrying the principle much
further than we have, and doing what our Society has been all
along particularly scrupulous not to do&mdash;has, in fact,
avoided upon declared principle&mdash;viz. hazarding an opinion
upon any question, when it has been previously before the
Bishop.&nbsp; If Dr. Molesworth finds all these Societies equally
to blame, pray let him do <i>equal</i> justice; and not reserve
all his indignation for us, <i>the last</i> and <i>the least</i>
offenders.&nbsp; If he is looking back to the pure theory of a
Church, and losing sight altogether of its present position, let
him confess the fact: but it is evident, in that case, he must
sue for a fresh trial against us, and enlarge the terms of
indictment; when we may chance to find ourselves pleading in such
good company as to cause us to rejoice in the prosecution.&nbsp;
At all events, the Society stands guiltless, at the present
moment, of having more influence in the appointment of spiritual
persons than the Church grants to those who provide its
temporalities; and, furthermore, is not without precedent in
established, <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>sanctioned, <i>Church</i> Societies, for every step it
has taken, and much more.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Having shewn that the <i>veto</i> is expedient, and
lawful, I next proceed to shew that the exercise of it is a
matter of Christian obligation.&nbsp; Who knows not that we are
responsible for all our talents, our time, influence, actions;
those which we do by ourselves, and those which we do by others,
or enable others to do?&nbsp; If by any remissness in the
management of funds set apart for sending <i>labourers into the
Lord&rsquo;s vineyard</i>, grievous wolves, profane or worldly
men, were introduced instead,&mdash;a contingency which is not so
remote, as we have seen,&mdash;how sad the perversion! how
painful the self-reproach!&nbsp; To be not only not attaining the
good result, but in league with, and carrying on the very
opposite evil, would convict the Society of raising funds to be
directed against itself, and to its own condemnation.&nbsp; We
are parties to the errors and to the sins of those men who work
only at our bidding, upon our wages.&nbsp; With what consistency
would a Society subscribing funds devoted to the glory of God and
the salvation of souls be afterwards heedless of inquiring into
whose hands they fell; knowing, at the same time, that they might
probably fall into such as would exhaust their bounty indeed, but
never advance their object?&nbsp; Where is principle, if men who
do apprehend the definition of &ldquo;faithful and
devoted,&rdquo; and believe that such men alone can supply the
spiritual destitution of our land, could willingly hand over
their funds to those of opposite principles, upon no better plea
than the cry of one man&mdash;in whom we cannot have any
particular confidence&mdash;that &ldquo;the Church is in
danger?&rdquo;&nbsp; We are bound, with a wise economy, to <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>husband our
resources for God, especially in the present disinclination or
delay on the part of the State, to provide for the moral
destitution of its evergrowing population: and how can we do
this, unless we ascertain how those resources are applied?&nbsp;
To give, is but a small part of our duty; but it is enough to
involve us in responsibility, as to the manner and measure, the
application and effect, of our gifts.&nbsp; In short, of all
matters over which conscience must preside, and pronounce a
verdict, there is none of more serious magnitude and consequence
than this, How shall I apply the funds contributed for preaching
the Gospel?&nbsp; The Society must follow the law of conscience
too: and what men would not do as individuals&mdash;contribute to
the circulation of error, and the support of unworthy men as
ministers of the Gospel&mdash;they will not do as members of this
Society;&mdash;they will earnestly, I trust prayerfully, guard
against it.&nbsp; Would the friends and supporters of the
Society, whilst they remained <i>in doubt</i> whether they were
doing <i>good or evil</i> in the Church, and what character was
borne by the Curates they maintained, whether &ldquo;faithful and
devoted&rdquo; or the reverse, (seeing that both are to be found
in the sacred office, the tares and the wheat together,) make the
exertion they now do&mdash;many of them, I believe, out of their
deep poverty&mdash;in support of the Society&rsquo;s funds?&nbsp;
Enough has been said, I think, to shew that it is no light thing,
when it is required of us to give up our power of influencing
others for their good; no light thing, when we are asked to
provide funds for a minister, without inquiring whether he is
good or bad; no light thing, when we are asked to lose sight of
our responsibility in the application of gifts we have devoted to
the glory of God.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>The
last thing I proposed to lay before you was the testimony of the
highest authorities of the Church to the character and services
of the Church Pastoral-Aid Society;&mdash;I may safely challenge
any Society in the Church to produce a more favourable one.&nbsp;
The following was the tribute of His Grace the Archbishop of
Canterbury in the House of Lords, July 27th of the present year,
in the debate on the Ecclesiastical Revenues&rsquo; Bill.&nbsp;
After stating that &ldquo;nearly 3,000,000 of our
Fellow-Christians in this land are utterly cut off from the
advantages of Religion and pastoral superintendence,&rdquo; the
Archbishop adds, &ldquo;The funds of Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty,
for the augmentation of small livings, were only 12,000<i>l.</i>
a-year; but considerable assistance in aid of that sum was
derived from <i>the Pastoral-Aid Society</i>, and the
Supplementary Curates&rsquo; Fund.&rdquo;&nbsp; I notice, first,
that if the Archbishop had thought the Society was doing more
evil than good with its fund, he never could have mentioned it
thus: secondly, that it is quoted as a Church Society, that is to
say, as belonging to the Church, and doing good service in it:
thirdly, that it is placed above the Supplementary Curates&rsquo;
Fund, according to its proper place, both on account of priority
of date and greater extent of usefulness.&nbsp; Other tributes of
our spiritual Heads under Christ were given at the last General
Meeting of the friends and supporters of the Society in May 1840,
a period not greatly preceding Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s attack:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Lichfield</span>
&ldquo;<i>felt</i>, <i>on behalf of his diocese at least</i>,
<span class="GutSmall">A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO THIS
SOCIETY</span>; there being at that moment thousands, he might
say tens of thousands, in that populous district, to whom <i>the
word of God was faithfully preached</i> every Sabbath-day,
<i>who</i>, <i>but for the assistance of this Society</i>,
<i>would have been without the means of grace</i>, <i>almost</i>,
<i>if not altogether</i>.&nbsp; But his satisfaction did not
arise merely from these <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>selfish considerations, but because
<i>he approved of the general principles on which the Society was
founded</i>, <i>and the plans on which it was carried
on</i>.&nbsp; <i>Those principles and plans had been</i>, <i>in
some instances</i>, <i>misrepresented</i>, <i>or perhaps</i>,
<i>he would rather say</i>, <i>misunderstood</i>.&nbsp; <i>There
was an impression on the minds of many</i>, <i>that this Society
preserved to itself a kind of jurisdiction independent of the
ecclesiastical authorities</i>.&nbsp; <i>Nothing could be more
erroneous than that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Ripon</span> said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He would willingly have been spared the
necessity of addressing them, but that he had one strong motive
for doing so; namely, that of declaring <i>the singular benefits
which this Society had been the means of conferring</i> upon the
diocese over which he had the honour to preside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Chester</span>
said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Over the space to which this Report refers,
only seventy-one Clergymen were engaged for this population
before the time when the aid of this Society came in; and this
was <i>one great reason</i>, <i>among many others</i>, <i>why he
should be grateful to a Society which had enabled him to look to
the vast concerns under his care with so much less anxiety of
mind</i>, <i>as to the means provided for their discharge</i>,
<i>than he could otherwise have hoped to have done</i>.&nbsp;
<i>But there was still a vast amount remaining of the benefits
which this Society had conferred upon the Church and upon the
people</i>, <i>and which could never be stated in the words of a
Report</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Norwich</span>
said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I willingly come forward in support of the
Church Pastoral-Aid Society.&nbsp; There are two Church
Pastoral-Aid Societies: <i>they are called rivals</i>, <i>but
they are established entirely and solely for the purpose of doing
good</i>.&nbsp; I welcome the introduction and success of the
Society; and I heartily wish it God speed, and that it may
prosper throughout the land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of Winchester having been prevented by domestic
affliction from attending the last public meeting, and the Bishop
of Llandaff being absent in his diocese, their testimony is
derived from public declarations of a year previous,
1839:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Bishop of <span
class="smcap">Winchester</span>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>He was bound</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>in the
spirit of unfeigned thankfulness</i>, <i>to add his testimony and
expression of gratitude to those already given</i>.&nbsp; He,
too, could refer to that part of the country over which he
presided in spiritual <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>things, as furnishing, to his own
knowledge, an amount of obligation to the Society for the timely
aid it had afforded to his clergy; and in many respects he could
testify both to its direct and indirect usefulness.&nbsp; He
could point to the stimulus to good works which it had given in
many quarters of his diocese, by the aid afforded through its
instrumentality: he could point to subscriptions raised on behalf
of additional churches; to school-rooms erected, and soon, as his
Right Rev. Brother had expressed it, to be converted into places
of worship, and endowed according to the use and form of the
National Church.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;<i>I rejoice in the
existence of this Society</i>, <i>and am thankful to God for
having put it into the hearts of many to aid this work of faith
and labour of love</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of <span class="smcap">Llandaff</span>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Right Rev. Prelate said, that though it
might appear late in the day, he had been anxious to make amends
for apparent neglect in past time, by taking part in the
proceedings of the Society, and <span class="GutSmall">ESPECIALLY
TO EXPRESS HIS BELIEF, THAT THAT PREJUDICE, WHICH FOR SOME TIME
HAD KEPT MANY BACK FROM SUPPORTING THIS DESIGN, WAS ENTIRELY
UNFOUNDED.&nbsp; EXAMINATION AND EXPERIENCE HAD TAUGHT
HIM</span>, that general, religious, and benevolent purposes
<span class="GutSmall">HAD ANIMATED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE
SOCIETY</span>, and <span class="GutSmall">A CAUTIOUS AND
SOBER-MINDED DESIRE NOT TO DEPART FROM THE TRUE DOCTRINES AND
DISCIPLINE OF THE CHURCH.&nbsp; HE COULD NOT BUT ADMIRE THE
CHRISTIAN TEMPER AND ABILITY WITH WHICH THE SOCIETY HAD BEEN
CONDUCTED, AND BY WHICH ITS MANAGERS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO LIVE DOWN
ALL PREJUDICE AND OPPOSITION. HE LOOKED TO THIS SOCIETY, THEN,
WHICH WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY A PARTY SPIRIT, AS A REMEDY FOR THE
EVIL</span>.&nbsp; He was happy to have this opportunity of
testifying his cordial approval of the designs and operations of
this Society.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late Bishop of <span class="smcap">Chichester</span> (as
well as the present, a Vice Patron of the Society), in supporting
the Resolution, bore his testimony to the excellent effects
produced by this Society, not only upon the country at large, but
upon that sphere of Christian action over which he had the
superintendence.</p>
<p>There is but one Layman whose testimony I shall quote; for I
know not where I should find another worthy to be added to the
above list, as an equally devoted and energetic friend of the
Church, and of <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>this Society.&nbsp; It is not so much Lord Ashley as
President of the Society, I quote, as Lord Ashley known and
esteemed in every relation of life, public and domestic, in
office and out of office,&mdash;by the Court, the statesman, the
operative, and the Christian.&nbsp; At the last public meeting,
Lord Ashley speaks thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perhaps in the history of all the Religious
Societies, there was no parallel to the sudden rise and rapid
progress of that which they were that day celebrating; no one on
which the blessing of God had more immediately and more
manifestly been bestowed.&nbsp; It was the very thing demanded by
the exigency of the times: and had accomplished, in proportion to
its means, the entire object for which it was instituted.&nbsp;
Of its holy and beneficial effects on private life, wherever its
labours extended, he would say nothing; they were amply and nobly
recorded in the periodical Reports; but he would assert his firm
and conscientious belief, that the operations of the Society had
mainly contributed to abate the hostility that had raged against
the Church of England; by making her known among those by whom
she was little known, to render her honoured and beloved, and to
enable her friends in another place to fight, under God&rsquo;s
providence, the great battle of our civil and ecclesiastical
constitution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here my labours might appropriately end, Dear friends and
supporters of the Church Pastoral-Aid Society! with giving you
the voice of the highest authorities of the Church in our
favour.&nbsp; All, therefore, I shall permit myself to add, is an
appeal to Dr. Molesworth himself&mdash;as one to whom we bear no
ill-will; as one who has not injured us at all, but rather
himself, by his late attack&mdash;warning him not again to peril
his respectable name on such an unjust and injudicious
<i>tirade</i> (for I can call it nothing else) against this
Society;&mdash;a Society so shielded from his attacks, that he
can only injure it through the sides of the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Church, of
which this Society is as a specimen of the young wood, and
vigorous growth, from that old yet glorious stem, planted by the
hands of the Apostles, and rooted in Christ.&nbsp; I exhort him
to lay aside his prejudice and his opposition, and join the
Society&mdash;as many of our members, I hear, have joined his;
when we will work together, &ldquo;the Lord being our
helper,&rdquo; to make the Society as perfect as we can.&nbsp;
Then, surely, he would learn to look at things in a more cheerful
aspect, and with less jaundiced eye, than to be raising a cry of
&ldquo;<i>schism</i>&rdquo; (p. 9) in the Church&mdash;a reproach
which could hardly be expected, and would certainly be untrue
(according to any definition that I have heard of the word), even
in the mouth of a bigoted Dissenter.&nbsp; I would appeal to the
Most Reverend Prelate from whom Dr. Molesworth&rsquo;s preferment
was derived (and whose known gentleness should have taught the
Clergyman whom he had preferred, &ldquo;a more excellent
way&rdquo;), not to suffer this unseemly <i>widening</i> of
<i>breaches</i> in the Church, if there be such; or, as I think,
<i>opening them</i>, where they would not exist without.&nbsp; Is
this &ldquo;the comprehensive, healing, uniting spirit of the
Articles&rdquo; (p. 15) which Dr. Molesworth loves?&nbsp; If it
is, I hope he will pardon me for saying (for I wish we might part
friends), that his is the most <i>abstract</i> love of the
principle of which I can form an idea.&nbsp; For my part, I have
never either made or acknowledged party distinctions in the
Church; nor will I be provoked to do so now.&nbsp; The Church I
have ever wished to regard as one body, with that mixture of
unworthiness in members which is consequent upon the imperfect
condition of all things here below: and I trust I do honour the
Church too much, lightly to foment her distractions, or expose <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>her troubles
to her numerous foes.&nbsp; Yet do not mistake, Dr.
Molesworth;&mdash;I value the Church for the sake of the Gospel,
not the Gospel for the sake of the Church;&mdash;I value both
Church and Gospel for their own sakes, and, by God&rsquo;s
blessing, will support and defend both, according to my poor
ability: but it is a truth I am not ashamed to confess, that if
by &lsquo;Church&rsquo; is to be understood the outward
frame-work of this or any other Church, I value the everlasting
Gospel <i>even more</i>, and <i>much more</i> than I do the
Church.&mdash;The Vicar of Rochdale may have time for
controversy: I have not.&nbsp; I have given him once for all what
appeared to me to be a full and satisfactory explanation of the
points at issue: let the Society&mdash;those to whom I address
myself&mdash;judge.&nbsp; I was quite unwilling that the
Committee should follow Dr. Molesworth to the field: I felt,
therefore, the more ready to give him the meeting myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;We feel some

of Mr.&mdash;&rsquo;s moral character, or of his <i>activity</i>
in his <i>ministerial duty</i>, but because we do not see that
<i>evidence</i> which <i>we</i> desire to receive of the
<i>orthodoxy</i> of his preaching:&mdash;that <i>we</i> are
deeply convinced that activity in the ministry can only be useful
so far as it is connected with the promulgation of those
doctrines which are taught in Holy Scriptures, and exhibited by
the Church as the <i>prominent</i> truths of Divine
Revelation.&nbsp; We do not mean to impute to Mr. &mdash;
deficiency in this respect, but <i>we</i> wish to be
<i>satisfied</i> that his <i>instructions</i> are such as, under
God&rsquo;s blessing, will promote the <i>great end</i> for which
our Society has been established&mdash;the salvation of souls
through the instrumentality of &lsquo;faithful and devoted
men.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
